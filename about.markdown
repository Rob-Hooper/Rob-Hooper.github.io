* One in a Million Dad
* Dad Rocks
* Crucifix

Well, somebody must like me if they think **I ROCK!**

Did you know that you can find crucifixes in Anglican, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox churches?  Crucifixes are often inscribed with INRI which stands for _Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum_ or Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.
