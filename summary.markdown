Now that you have seen my desk, who do you think I am?  Still not sure?  Let's recap:

* Dad items
* Religious items
* OPSEC poster
* Challenge coins

Got it now?  Let's see how your impression of me compares with the real me.

* * * *

I am a **Christian, Husband, Father, Veteran and Information Security Manager.**

I am Catholic and my faith is a very important to me.  The calendar reminds me of the beauty that can be found in all religions and the crucifix reminds me of my salvation because of the Jesus’ sacrifice for all of us. 

I have been married for over 20 years, and I am in love with my wife now as much as when we first got married.  I am a father to three children, ages 11 to 20.  Eeach of them is wildly different from the other and I would do anything for them.  I have a box full of knick-knacks from them that would fill up my desk three times over, so I’ve had to pick only a few.

I served in the military for 30 years before retiring.  I am proud of my service, but I am even more proud of all the servicemembers, past, present, and future that have made countless sacrifices in the service of their country!  The [Pew Research Center]( https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/08/the-changing-face-of-americas-veteran-population/) estimates that in 2022, only **6%** of the US population has served in the military and of those 18.3 million individuals, 78% served during wartime.  These men and women are true heroes in my eyes.

Am I creative and open to new experiences?  Well, sort of.  The guillotine and catapult were gifts from my wife, but I bought the contemplative monkey.  The toys are great conversation starters, and I like meeting new people and striking up conversations, but creative… no.  I wish I were, but I am a follow the recipe kind of guy.  That is why Information Security appeals to me.  There are frameworks and prescriptions for dealing with risk and protecting information.

So, how did you do?  What does your desk say about you?
