![Rob's Desk](Desktop.jpg)

What can you tell about a person from looking at their desk?

According to the [DeskTime Blog](https://desktime.com/blog/what-does-your-desk-say-about-you-infographic), we spend on average 5 hours and 41 minutes at our desk.  So, it is no wonder that it becomes a personal representation of ourselves.  My desk is no exception.

Click on the links at the top of the page to view my desk up close and see if you can develop a sense of who I am.  At the end, you can compare your profile of me to who I really am.
